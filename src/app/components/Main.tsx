                Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr
                themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and
                web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the

                    My main focus these days is building products and leading
                    projects for our clients at Upstatement. In my free time

                    everything you need to know to build a web app with the
                    Spotify API.

                    When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing,
                    hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around
