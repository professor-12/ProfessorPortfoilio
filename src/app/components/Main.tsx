                Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr
                themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and
                web development. Fast-forward to today, and I&apos;ve had the
                privilege of building software for an{" "}

                    My main focus these days is building products and leading
                    projects for our clients at Upstatement. In my free time
                    I&apos;ve also released an online video course that covers
                    everything you need to know to build a web app with the
                    Spotify API.

                    hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around
